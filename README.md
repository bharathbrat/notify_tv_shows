Notifier for TV shows

Script can be used as a cron that runs every x minutes/hours to notify you when a TV show you are following is available on the front page of kat.cr

Pushbullet android application is required to receive notifications. Feel free to change this if any other elegant solution is available. :-)

shows.txt -> List of TV shows you are interested in.
sent.json -> Populated to keep track of notifications already sent.
